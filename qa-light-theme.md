# Light Theme QA

The light theme works well overall. The homepage has a clean white background with proper contrast on text and cards. The game card images still look great against the light background. The hero banner text "PIXEL PLAYGROUND" and subtitle are readable against the dark banner image. The Settings page also renders correctly in light mode with proper button states.

One minor observation: the game card titles use the arcade color scheme (mint, coral, indigo) which provides good contrast against both light and dark backgrounds.

All 6 game cards visible. Theme toggle persists across navigation.
